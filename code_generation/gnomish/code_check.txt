Here is the output obtained when running the proposed code with the unit test:

"
{}
"

Here was the desired strategy:

You are now faced with the task of finding the Gnomish Mines.

Write the code for "perform_task" method such that the player reaches the Gnomish Mines.

You should make use of the two existing methods.  The "reach_gnomish_mines" method brings the player to the Gnomish Mines from the Dungeons of Doom. The "reach_dungeons_of_doom" method brings the player to the Dungeons of Doom from the Gnomish Mines. 

Does the output seem correct to you? Yes or no. Tell me why you say so.

Do not write any code.
