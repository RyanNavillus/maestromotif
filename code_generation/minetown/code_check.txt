Here is the output obtained when running the proposed code with the unit test:

"
{}
"

Here was the desired strategy:

Minetown is located in the Gnomish Mines (branch number 2) and can appear as low as a depth of 8. The Gnomish Mines form a secondary branch (branch number 2) starting from branch_depth+1.

Write the code for "perform_task" method such that the player reaches the Gnomish Mines, and then, heads directly for Minetown, without exploring further.

You should make use of the two existing methods.  The "reach_gnomish_mines" method brings the player to the Gnomish Mines from the Dungeons of Doom. The "reach_dungeons_of_doom" method brings the player to the Dungeons of Doom from the Gnomish Mines. 

Does the output seem correct to you? Yes or no. Tell me why you say so.

Do not write any code.
