Here is the output obtained when running the proposed code with the unit test:

"
{}
"

Here was the desired strategy:

You are now faced with the task of interacting with a shopkeeper by successfully selling items.

Write the code for "perform_task" method such that the player interacts with the shopkeeper, which appears more often in the Dungeons of Doom.

You should make use of the two existing methods.  The "reach_gnomish_mines" method brings the player to the Gnomish Mines from the Dungeons of Doom. The "reach_dungeons_of_doom" method brings the player to the Dungeons of Doom from the Gnomish Mines. 

Shopkeepers only appear after dungeon depth 1 in the Dungeons of Doom, modify "merchant_precondition" accordingly.

Does the output seem correct to you? Yes or no. Tell me why you say so.

Do not write any code.
