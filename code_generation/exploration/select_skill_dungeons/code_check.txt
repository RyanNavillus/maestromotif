Here is the output obtained when running the proposed code with the unit test:

"
{}
"

Here was the desired strategy:

The strategy should be the following: at branch_depth, the player should always attempt to descend into the Dungeons of Doom (branch number 0) at  branch_depth+1. Because the Descender can't tell which staircase at branch_depth leads to which branch, it is inevitable that the Player may descend into the Gnomish Mines at branch_depth+1 multiple times.

If the descent to branch_depth+1 leads the agent to the Gnomish Mines (branch number 2), the player should immediately attempt to ascend to branch_depth and try again descending further into the Dungeons of Doom (branch number 0).

Once deeper in the Dungeons of Doom the player can behave as usual with the exploration strategy involving the skills.

The reach_dungeons_of_doom method cannot modify the branch_number variable, but it should call the select_skill method.

Does the output seem correct to you? Yes or no. Tell me why you say so.

Do not write any code.
