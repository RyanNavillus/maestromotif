You are to write code which defines the method "reach_dungeons_of_doom" of the NetHack Player class that selects amongst a set of skills in the videogame of NetHack. The set of skills corresponds to {{"discoverer", "descender", "ascender", "merchant", "worshipper"}}. 

When activated, the Discoverer fully explores the current dungeon, while fighting off enemies. The Descender makes its way to a staircase and goes down. The Ascender makes its way to a staircase and goes up. The Merchant interacts with shopkeepers by selling its items. The Worshipper interacts with altars by identifying its items.

Previously, you have implemented the "select_skill" method which allowed for exploration through the first few dungeon levels, as shown here:

Here is additional information with respect to the layout of the NetHack game.

The Dungeons of Doom (branch number 0) constitute the main branch going from depth 1 to max_depth. At branch_depth, a second staircase appears opening the door towards the Gnomish Mines (branch number 2) at branch_depth+1. Therefore, the Gnomish Mines constitute a second branch from branch_depth+1 to max_depth.

Each time the Descender descends from branch_depth to branch_depth+1, it has 0.5 chance of continuing either into the Dungeons of Doom (branch number 0) or entering the Gnomish Mines (branch number 2).

The strategy should be the following: at branch_depth, the player should always attempt to descend into the Dungeons of Doom (branch number 0) at  branch_depth+1. Because the Descender can't tell which staircase at branch_depth leads to which branch, it is inevitable that the Player may descend into the Gnomish Mines at branch_depth+1 multiple times.

If the descent to branch_depth+1 leads the agent to the Gnomish Mines (branch number 2), the player should immediately attempt to ascend to branch_depth and try again descending further into the Dungeons of Doom (branch number 0).

Once deeper in the Dungeons of Doom the player can behave as usual with the exploration strategy involving the skills.

The reach_dungeons_of_doom method cannot modify the branch_number variable, but it should call the select_skill method.

Your code will be verified through this unit test. 

###

# Starting conditions
skill = 'discoverer'
dungeon_depth = 1
branch_number = 0

max_depth = 4 # to be defined

# the environment decides on the branch_depth
branch_depth = 2

player = NetHackPlayer(max_depth, branch_depth)

for turn in range(20):
    print(f"Turn {{turn + 1}}: Skill = {{skill}}, Dungeon depth = {{dungeon_depth}}, Branch Number = {{branch_number}}")

    merchant_precondition = player.merchant_precondition()
    worshipper_precondition = player.worshipper_precondition()

    skill = player.reach_dungeons_of_doom(skill, dungeon_depth, branch_number, merchant_precondition, worshipper_precondition)

    # the environment updates the dungeon_depth
    if skill == 'descender':
        dungeon_depth += 1
    elif skill == 'ascender':
        dungeon_depth -= 1

    # the environment modifies the branch_number when descending from branch_depth
    if skill == "descender" and dungeon_depth == branch_depth+1:
        branch_number = random.choice([0, 2])
    # If player ascends from gnomish mines, it necessarily goes back to the dungeons of doom
    elif skill == "ascender" and dungeon_depth == branch_depth and branch_number == 2:
        branch_number = 0

Before writing the code, write a few questions for yourself, and answer them to make sure you understand the assignment. Explain what you can and cannot control in the environment.

Clearly state what is your strategy and the output you want by running the code.

In your response make sure to include the code for the class definition and the unit test in a python markdown.
