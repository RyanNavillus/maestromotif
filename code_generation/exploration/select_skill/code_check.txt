Here is the output obtained when running the proposed code with the unit test:

"
{}
"

Here was the desired strategy:

When activated, the Discoverer fully explores the current dungeon, while fighting off enemies. Note that it only takes one turn to explore each level. The Descender makes its way to a staircase and goes down. The Ascender makes its way to a staircase and goes up. The Merchant interacts with shopkeepers by selling its items. The Worshipper interacts with altars by identifying its items.

Find a strategy that will let the player explore fully each of the first few dungeon levels, alternating directions between going all the way down towards the maximum depth, then going up towards the first dungeon. This might get interrupted by the end of the loop or if the preconditions of worshipper and merchant allow for it.
