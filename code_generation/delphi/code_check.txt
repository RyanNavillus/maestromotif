Here is the output obtained when running the proposed code with the unit test:

"
{}
"

Here was the desired strategy:

The Oracle level is located in the Dungeons of Doom (branch number 0) and can appear as low as a depth of 9. The Gnomish Mines form a secondary branch (branch number 2) starting from branch_depth+1.

Write the code for "perform_task" method such that the player reaches the Oracle level as fast as possible, rather than exploring the first few levels or venturing into the Gnomish Mines.

You should make use of the two existing methods.  The "reach_gnomish_mines" method brings the player to the Gnomish Mines from the Dungeons of Doom. The "reach_dungeons_of_doom" method brings the player to the Dungeons of Doom from the Gnomish Mines. 

Does the output seem correct to you? Yes or no. Tell me why you say so.

Do not write any code.
