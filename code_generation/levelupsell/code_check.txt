Here is the output obtained when running the proposed code with the unit test:

"
{}
"

Here was the desired strategy:

Do not leave the first dungeon level until you achieve XP level 4, then find a shopkeeper and sell an item that you have collected; finally survive for another 300 steps.

The Dungeons of Doom (branch number 0) constitute the main branch starting from depth 1. At branch_depth, a second staircase appears opening the door towards the Gnomish Mines (branch number 2) at branch_depth+1. Therefore, the Gnomish Mines constitute a second branch from branch_depth+1.

You should make use of the two existing methods.  The "reach_gnomish_mines" method brings the player to the Gnomish Mines from the Dungeons of Doom. The "reach_dungeons_of_doom" method brings the player to the Dungeons of Doom from the Gnomish Mines. 

Shopkeepers only appear after dungeon depth 1 in the Dungeons of Doom, modify "merchant_precondition" accordingly. One turn in the unit test can increase the step counter by 300.

Does the output seem correct to you? Yes or no. Tell me why you say so.

Do not write any code.
