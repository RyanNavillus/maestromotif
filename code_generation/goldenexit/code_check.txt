Here is the output obtained when running the proposed code with the unit test:

"
{}
"

Here was the desired strategy:

Alternate between the first three levels of the Dungeons of Doom (at least once) until you collect a minimum of 20 gold pieces and defeat 25 monsters; finally try to quit NetHack (reach dungeon level 0).

The Dungeons of Doom (branch number 0) constitute the main branch starting from depth 1. At branch_depth, a second staircase appears opening the door towards the Gnomish Mines (branch number 2) at branch_depth+1. Therefore, the Gnomish Mines constitute a second branch from branch_depth+1.

You should make use of the two existing methods.  The "reach_gnomish_mines" method brings the player to the Gnomish Mines from the Dungeons of Doom. The "reach_dungeons_of_doom" method brings the player to the Dungeons of Doom from the Gnomish Mines. 

The Ascender will attempt to quit the dungeon if activated in dungeon depth 1 (going to dungeon level 0 means quitting). Each skill execution may collect multiple gold coins or destroy multiple enemies.

Does the output seem correct to you? Yes or no. Tell me why you say so.

Do not write any code.
